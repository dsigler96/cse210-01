# Jumper

    This game is a variation of hangman, but with a parachute instead.  The goal is to guess the letters of the word before you run out of parachute.

## Rules

    You have 4 lives before you are out of parachute, so guess the 5 letter word as quickly as you can.  Guessing a correct letter doesn't waste a life.
