Purpose:
The seeker game is a version of hot or cold.  The goal is to correctly guess the number that has been chosen by the program as quickly as possible.
After entering a number, the program will tell you if you are getting warmer (closer) or colder (farther) from the random number.

Build:
The program has 4 classes: Director, Seeker, Hider, and Service
The director class combines all the classes and directs the program
The seeker class gets the user input and feeds it back to the director
The hider class knows which number has been chosen and gives hints
The service class shows readable output to the user to inform them
