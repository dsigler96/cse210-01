Dice Game by Devin Sigler

To start this program, execute the main python function.  You will then play a game of Dice
where the goal is to accumulate as many points as possible.  If you do not roll a 1 or 5,
you lose all points accumulated.  If you roll a 1, you gain 100 points and if you roll a 
5, you gain 50 points.  You can choose to end the game at any time.
